;; Authority test for kotoba/capability_admission_core.kotoba.
;;
;; The binding that matters most here is the BIT ORDER. `effect-bit` assigns
;; bit i to index i of :effect-ops, so reordering that vector — which looks
;; like formatting — silently changes what every stored mask means. Nothing
;; else in the repo would notice. This test does.
;;
;; The rest checks the algebra as laws rather than as examples, because the
;; consumer folds `effect-bit` over an arbitrary program: the cases that break
;; it are the ones nobody thought to write down.
;;
;; The compiler is test-only (ADR-reliability-t63).
