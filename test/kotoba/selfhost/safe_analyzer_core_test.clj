;; Authority test for kotoba/safe_analyzer_core.kotoba.
;;
;; The point of this file is that neither side can move alone:
;;
;;   safe_analyzer_facts.edn   owns WHICH ops are in each class
;;   safe_analyzer_core.kotoba owns WHAT IT MEANS to be in one
;;
;; Two checks bind them. The semantic one runs every op in the union of all
;; four tables through every predicate and demands exact agreement with the
;; EDN — which catches a missing entry AND an entry copied into the wrong
;; predicate. The structural one counts the `string=?` comparisons in each
;; predicate body, which catches the case the semantic check cannot see: an op
;; admitted by the .kotoba that appears in no table at all, so the union never
;; offers it as an input.
;;
;; The compiler is test-only (ADR-reliability-t63). Nothing in src/ requires it.
