(ns kotoba.selfhost.oracle
  "Loads and calls the shipped Kotoba decisions.

  `kotoba/*.kotoba` holds the decisions; `resources/kotoba/selfhost/oracle/*.kir.edn`
  is the compiled artifact that ships. This namespace is the seam between them,
  and it is deliberately thin: it resolves a resource, executes an export, and
  does not decide anything itself.

  The compiler is NOT here. It produced the artifacts under `:test` and is not
  on this classpath (ADR-reliability-t63: the compiler is a build/analysis tool;
  the artifact is what runs). Regenerate with `clojure -M:test:gen`.

  A missing or unreadable artifact throws rather than falling back to a host
  reimplementation. A silent fallback is how a decision stops being the one that
  shipped, and this repo already lost an analyzer that way once.

  TWO ENGINES, ONE DECISION
  -------------------------
  By default the shipped KIR runs on the reference interpreter, in this JVM.
  `open-native!` points this process at a native build of the same `.kotoba`
  instead, and every caller of `call` — `kotoba.selfhost.analyzer` is the whole
  of it — follows without changing a line. That is the point of keeping this
  namespace thin: the choice of engine is not a fact any consumer should have
  to know.

  It is opt-in, never a fallback in either direction. If a native build is
  requested and anything about it is missing or unverifiable, this throws. Two
  engines are only worth having if something binds them to the same answers,
  which is what `test-native/` does across the whole fact table.

  Cost, measured on an M4 for `safe_analyzer_core` (19k-word module): the
  interpreter answers in about 2 ms; a native session costs ~4 s to open once
  and then ~20-50 ms per call, nearly all of it process spawn. Native is the
  right engine when the work per call is large, and the interpreter is the
  right one for a word-typed predicate. Neither is `faster` unqualified."
